  New Scientist Piece (May 2025)
</h3>

My work at Caltech and the USGS was featured in a wonderful popular science piece on fiber-optic sensing with telecom fibers. Andreas Fichtner, Jonathan Ajo-Franklin, Andreas Wustefeld, Daniel Bowden, and Rafael Mestre are some of the other scientists featured.

  The Earthquake Fellows Program
</h3>

The Earthquake Fellows Program at Caltech is a new outreach initiative that introduces local high school students to scientific research through the lens of seismology. The goal of the program is to give students from groups that are underrepresented in science an opportunity to see what a career in science looks like. I was lucky enough to be involved in Earthquake Fellows throughout its first two years and had the opportunity to help shape the program's curriculum and objectives.
