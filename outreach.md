  Cal Poly Humboldt Feature (December 2025)
</h3>

Cal Poly Humboldt campus news recently joined us for a big expansion of our DAS array in Humboldt County. We enlisted the help of Cal Poly geology students for the tap test used to locate the channels. Lots of hammer swinging and head scratching; overall a successful day. Learn more in the [article](https://now.humboldt.edu/news/new-project-turns-internet-lines-earthquake-monitoring-system-video) and the accompanying video.

  The Earthquake Fellows Program (September 2022)
</h3>

The Earthquake Fellows Program at Caltech is a new outreach initiative that introduces local high school students to scientific research through the lens of seismology. The goal of the program is to give students from groups that are underrepresented in science an opportunity to see what a career in science looks like. I was lucky enough to be involved in Earthquake Fellows throughout its first two years and had the opportunity to help shape the program's curriculum and objectives. Check out [this link](https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/caltech-earthquake-fellows) to learn more.
