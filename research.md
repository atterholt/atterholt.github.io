### Robustly describing earthquake ruptures (Jul 2021)

Earthquake ruptures mostly happen deep within the Earth, and seismologists try to describe these ruptures using wiggles produced by seismometers that are usually far away and at the surface of the Earth. So, data coverage in seismology is inherently deficient, and this makes solving for rupture parameters challenging. Typically, seismologists try to infer rupture parameters using complicated optimization problems that are poorly constrained. To get more robust estimates of rupture parameters, we developed a framework to solve for so-called stress glut second moments using a fully Bayesian inverse scheme. In short, this framework can yield a low-dimensional, probabilistic description of an earthquake ruptureâ€™s spatial extent, propagation direction, and duration. We successfully test this technique on the 2020 Mw 7.7 Caribbean Earthquake. Check out the preprint [here](https://www.essoar.org/doi/10.1002/essoar.10507583.1).

### Sensing the fabric of rocks (Jan 2021)
Many metamorphic rocks have a so-called "fabric." This fabric exists because these rocks are smushed so much during metamorphism, the crystals in the rocks become systematically aligned. This alignment makes these rocks anisotropic, meaning their elastic properties change with orientation. Although we expect anisotropy in rocks to affect our seismic observations at all scales, there have been few studies that examine how anisotropy might affect seismic observations at scales in between those of hand-samples and large crustal models. In our recent study, which includes the bulk of my undergraduate thesis, we set out to better understand anisotropy at these intermediate scales. To do this, we examined directional variability in P-wave travel-times and particle-motions using high frequency data from an active source experiment performed in the Homestake Mine in South Dakota.
