# About Me

Welcome! I'm an observational seismologist and PhD student at Caltech working under the advisement of Zach Ross and Zhongwen Zhan. My research incorporates techniques from applied mathematics and new instrumentation to better understand earthquake source processes and crustal structures. When I'm not looking at wiggle plots, I can be found jogging around Pasadena or enjoying the LA Opera. For my complete publication record, please visit my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1rW1gSwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Also, check out some of my software on my [Github page](https://github.com/atterholt).
