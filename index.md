# About Me

Welcome! I'm an observational seismologist and PhD student at Caltech working under the advisement of Zach Ross and Zhongwen Zhan. My research incorporates techniques from applied mathematics and new instrumentation to better understand earthquake source processes and crustal structures. When I'm not looking at wiggle plots, I can be found jogging around Pasadena or enjoying the LA Opera. For my complete publication record, please visit my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1rW1gSwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

#### Sensing the fabric of rocks (Jan 2021)
Many metamorphic rocks have a so-called "fabric." This fabric exists because these rocks are smushed so much during metamorphism, the crystals in the rocks become systematically aligned. This alignment makes these rocks anisotropic, meaning their elastic properties change with direction. Although we expect anisotropy in rocks to affect our seismic observations at all scales, there have been few studies that examine how anisotropy might affect seismic observations at scales in between those of hand-samples and large crustal models. In our recent study, which includes the bulk of my undergraduate thesis, we set out to better understand anisotropy at these intermediate scales. To do this, we examined directional variability in P-wave travel-times and particle-motions using high frequency data from an active source experiment performed in the Homestake Mine in South Dakota.
