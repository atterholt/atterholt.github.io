# About Me

Welcome! I'm an observational seismologist and PhD student at Caltech working under the advisement of Zach Ross and Zhongwen Zhan. My research incorporates techniques from applied mathematics and new instrumental tools to better characterize and understand earthquake source processes and fault zone structure. When I'm not looking at wiggle plots, I can be found jogging around Pasadena or enjoying the LA opera.

## Research

Many metamorphic rocks have a "fabric" to them, because these rocks have been smushed so much their crystals are systematically aligned. This alignment makes these rocks anisotropic, meaning their elastic properties change with direction. Although we expect anisotropy in rocks to affect our seismic observations at all scales, there have been few studies that examine how anisotropy might affect seismic observations at scales in between hand-samples and large-scale crustal models. In our recent study, which includes the bulk of my undergraduate thesis, we set out to better understand anisotropy at these intermediate scales. To do this, we examined directional variability in P-wave travel-times and particle-motions using high frequency data collected during an active source experiment performed in the Homestake Mine in South Dakota.
